    "This is the 5th exercise to complete in order to finish your `Python API Training for DataRobot` course! This exercise teaches you how to leverage DataRobot in order to create a model factory. That could help you increase model accuracy and shows you the true capabilities of an AutoML platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the actual sections of the notebook alongside time to complete: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect to DataRobot. [3min]<br>\n",
    "2. Create a Pandas Dataframe with the `readmissions` dataset. [3min]\n",
    "3. Create a DataRobot Project with the `readmissions` dataset explicitly using `quick` autopilot. [5min]\n",
    "4. Split the dataset and run multiple DataRobot Projects based on the `admission_type_id` column explicitly using `quick` autopilot. [25min]\n",
    "5. Check the validation and cross validation scores of the best models for each one of the projects. What do you see? [15min]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section will have specific instructions so do not worry if things are still blurry!\n",
