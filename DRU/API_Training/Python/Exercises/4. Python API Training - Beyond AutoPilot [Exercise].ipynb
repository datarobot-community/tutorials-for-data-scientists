    "\n",
    "<b>Author:</b> Thodoris Petropoulos <br>\n",
    "<b>Contributors:</b> Rajiv Shah\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the 4th exercise to complete in order to finish your `Python API Training for DataRobot` course! This exercise will help you learn how to use the repository and advanced tuning to create models that are better than the autopilot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the actual sections of the notebook alongside time to complete: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect to DataRobot. [3min]<br>\n",
    "2. Retrieve the Project created during the `Feature Selection Curves` exercise. [5min]<br>\n",
    "3. Retrieve validation and cross-validation AUC score for best current model. [7min]\n",
    "4. Run models with `Keras` within their `model_type` (64 `sample_pct`). [15min]\n",
    "5. Check whether you created a model with a better validation score. [10min]\n",
    "6. Sort all models by cross validation score. [15min]\n",
    "7. Retrieve a specific model and change a specific hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section will have specific instructions so do not worry if things are still blurry!\n",
