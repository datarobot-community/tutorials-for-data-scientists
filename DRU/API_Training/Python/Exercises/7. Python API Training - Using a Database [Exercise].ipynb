    "\n",
    "This is the 7th exercise to complete in order to finish your Python API Training for DataRobot course! This exercise teaches you how to use a database in order to read datasets in order to train models or dump your predictions in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the actual sections of the notebook alongside time to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect to DataRobot. [3min]\n",
    "2. Connect to the SQLite database provided. [5min]\n",
    "3. Load the `readmissions` dataset that needs scoring. [10min]\n",
    "4. Use one of the deployments generated earlier to score the dataset. [15min]\n",
    "5. Writeback predictions in the database\n",
