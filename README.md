# Tutorials for Data Scientists

This repository contains various end to end use-case examples using the DataRobot API. Each use-case directory contains instructions for its own use.

A simple example to get you started can be found [Here](https://github.com/datarobot-community/tutorials-for-data-scientists/blob/master/Classification/Python/predict_hospital_readmissions/src/readmissions_tutorial.ipynb). Also executable through Google Colab.

## Usage

For each respective guide, follow the instructions in its own `.ipynb` or `.Rmd` file. 

**Please pay attention to the different DataRobot API Endpoints**

The API endpoint you specify for accessing DataRobot is dependent on the deployment environment, as follows:

- AI Platform Trial—https://app2.datarobot.com/api/v2
- US Managed AI Cloud—https://app.datarobot.com/api/v2
- EU Managed AI Cloud—https://app.eu.datarobot.com/api/v2
- On-Premise—https://{datarobot.example.com}/api/v2 
       (replacing {datarobot.example.com} with your specific deployment endpoint
       
The DataRobot API Endpoint is used to connect your IDE to DataRobot.

- *Database Connections and Writebacks:* DataRobot provides a “self-service” JDBC product for database connectivity setup. Once configured, you can read data from production databases for model building and predictions. This allows you to quickly train and retrain models on that data, and avoids the unnecessary step of exporting data from your enterprise database to a CSV for ingest to DataRobot.
