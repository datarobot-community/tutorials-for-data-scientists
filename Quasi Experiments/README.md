# PSM for Quasi-Experimentation with DataRobot

This repository contains copies of 2 Zepl notebooks used to demonstrate Quasi-experimentation with DataRobot using Python and R. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is the approach leveraged to conduct the quasi-experiments. This allows us to estimate treatment effects (i.e. causal inference) with less bias and greater accuracy than traditional regression modeling.

## Usage

Make sure the required libaries are installed in your Zepl image (or in Python and R, if running directly). Python requires datarobot and pandas. R requires caret, e1071, and Matching. Code to install the R libraries are included in the R script and Zepl notebook; for Python libraries can be installed with pip. 

## Repository Contents

This repo contains 2 sub-directories corresponding to 2 Zepl notebooks (PSM demos). Each sub-directory contains the Zepl notebook as a .pdf, .zpln, and .json file. Additionally, Python and R code has been transcribed to .py and .R files for those who do not wish to use Zepl.
